# WiFi scanner
This is taken from David Bombal's YouTube video reagrding how to crack a WiFi password using hashcat and hcxdumptool, if you have not watched the video I would advise you to do so since this script does not crack any password, but it makes the process of getting the files needed faster and easier:
