# WiFi scanner
This is taken from David Bombal's YouTube video, so all credit goes to him. If you have not watched the video I would advise you to do so since this script does not crack any password, the commands showed in the video of capturing the WiFi handshake and converting the pcapng file to a hc22000 file are all wrapped up in a script making the process faster and easier:
